The "break" statement
*********************

   break_stmt ::= "break"

"break" may only occur syntactically nested in a "for" or "while"
loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within that
loop.

It terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional "else"
clause if the loop has one.

If a "for" loop is terminated by "break", the loop control target
keeps its current value.

When "break" passes control out of a "try" statement with a "finally"
clause, that "finally" clause is executed before really leaving the
loop.
